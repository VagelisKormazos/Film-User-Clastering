# Recommendation Algorithm Using Artificial Neural Networks

## Introduction
This code implements a recommendation algorithm using artificial neural networks.

## Pre-processing Data
1. Load the dataset from the given URL: [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/imdb-movie-reviews-dataset).
2. Extract the unique users and movies from the dataset.
3. Create frequency histograms for user ratings.
4. Convert the dataset into preference vectors.

## Data Grouping
1. Perform k-means clustering on the restricted set of users using different metrics.
2. Visualize the clusters using graphs.

## Recommendation Generation
1. Organize users into clusters based on a chosen metric.
2. Develop multilayer neural networks for each user cluster.
3. Partition users into training and testing sets.
4. Train the neural networks using the training data.
5. Test the performance of the neural networks using the testing data.

## Conclusion
This code provides a framework for implementing recommendation algorithms using artificial neural networks and clustering techniques.
